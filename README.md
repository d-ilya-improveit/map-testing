# Test task

## Info

- Done: map that includes around 10 brands, located in Europe. Move or zoom map to see them (you can zoom to the size of Earth). These brands will appear in side-list. By clicking on list or marker the modal will appear.
- Skipped: brands don't have logos, as it requires additional services for storing files. The design is not responsive, works only on large screens.
